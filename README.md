# Movie-Trailer-Website

Program: Udacity Full Stack Web Development Nanodegree

This project is to build a movie website in Python, which displays a list of my favourite movies. Each movie contains its title, storyline, poster image and the link to its YouTube trailer.

Installation:

Install Python 2.7.9. For this project, I used Atom instead of IDLE. If you prefer to use Atom or Sublime, please install them as well.
